# My project's README

To work on that exercise, I used the following tools:
Charts.js JavaScript library (with filler plugin) - to draw the chart
Font Awesome library - to implement icons
Data is stored as variables in external JS file (in this case I use ES6 import)
To standard resetCSS (http://cssreset.com/scripts/eric-meyer-reset-css/)
I added corrections for <sub></sub> (https://gist.github.com/unruthless/413930)

Comment - in my opinion, data on the mockup charts are not corresponding to the numbers in "Revenue stream"
and "Installations", that said, the numbers are not the sum of that values. I decided to sum the data
from the chart.
